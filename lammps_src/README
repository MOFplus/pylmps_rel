lammps_src
==========

This dir contains C++ code to be used in lammps in connection with the pylmps wrapper.
In order to use it, copy the <name>.cpp and <name.h> files to the /src directory of
your current lammps version (recommended: pull stable from github).
Then recompile. In certain cases further steps are necessary, see below.
                                                            (RS)


dump_pdlp
---------

Adds a dump style to lammps that allows to write HDF5 files (including restart, system and
trajectory data) to a HDF5 file in the pdlp format (traditionally used with pydlpoly). Note
that this code only adds to exisiting datasets and it *must* be used in connection with
pylmps.

Inorder to compile the library libhdf5 and hdf5.h must be accesible. The most straight forward way
to get this working is to install first the h5md extension. IF you get this compiled the path to 
the library and header file of HDF% are available and the dump_pdlp extension should compile easily.

Follow these steps to add the h5md extension:
- in the lammps dir "cd lib/h5md"
- compile the ch5md library with "make -f Makefile.h5cc"
- In order to access the hdf5 files you might have to edit the file Makefile.lammps
  Mine looks like this (UBUNTU based MINT):
  
  h5md_SYSINC = -I/usr/include/hdf5/serial
  h5md_SYSLIB = -L/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/hdf5/serial/ -lhdf5

  the first entry points to the leader file (try "locate hdf5.h" to find it)
  the second entry points to the lib (try "locate libhdf5")
- Now cd back to the /src directoy "cd ../../src"
- switch extension on with "make yes-USER-H5MD"
- recompile with "make mode=shlib mpi"
